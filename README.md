## description

This project is a quiz with high scores from local storage. When the user hits start quiz, a timer will start and a question will be received with answers created as buttons. When the user picks a correct answer, their time will increase. When the user picks an incorrect answer, their time will decrease. If their time reaches zero, they lose. If they make it through all the questions before then, they win and can save their time as a high score. This will be displayed in the high score section.
